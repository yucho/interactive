Telling by showing the skills and experience. [Live Demo](https://yuchoho.com/resume/)

### Background and Overview
#### Motivation for project
Traditional pdf resume and portfolio websites are great. But as a full-stack developer, nothing speaks out more than demonstrating your skill through interactive online resume, where the recruiters can visually understand what you are capable of doing. Inspired by [Robby Leonardi](http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/) and [Valentin Marmonier](http://vaalentin.github.io/2015/).
